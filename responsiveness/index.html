    <div class="flexible">One of the first things I did when having access to a family laptop was create a Club Penguin account. My brother and sister who were older naturally were big influences and I loved to watch them play it (which they probably found annoying), and I made my own account. I had extremely loose reign of access to the great internet and I’m glad I used most of that free will playing Club Penguin. It’s a multiplayer game so it felt exciting to know I was playing with other kids.</div>
