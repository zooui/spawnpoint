            <li>baby berthas can be placed and parked anywhere, there are thumbtacks for interior attatching (yes you can poke the fabric what do i care)</li>
            <li>get in and look around! open doors, compartments, trunk, windows, etc. or just watch and listen but i recommend exploring inside</li>
            <li>window switches are attached to center console</li>
            <li>avoid trying to lock and unlock the car because bertha's alarm is the worst teehee!</li>
            <li>let me know if you need assistance</li>
            <li>enjoy the visualizer and audio (which are separate pieces :D)</li>
