        <summary><p>Week 2: J.R. Carpenter: A Handmade Web</p></summary>
        <p>"In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity." - Anil Dash<br></br> I pulled this quote because it reminds me how I feel a certain discomfort posting artwork or pieces of myself that "represent me" online. I always feels like my prescence on whichever popular host site it may be feels inauthenic to what I would truly want to create for myself. I don't want to seem like I'm selling anything to anyone and many social platforms have sales as a large part of their existence ironically. And to me a website compared to a popular social platform can be more intimate or secretive, as the creator you set the tone of your own site, expand your expressiveness and feel better about no one or nothing watching you (hey secret insta/tiktok/facebook data agent are you in there?)<br></br>"Whereas archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere — manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to change"</p>

        <summary><p>Week 3: Hello, World! - Taeyoon Choi</p></summary>
        <p>"Every day we look at computer screens for a very long time. We touch them, carry them, sleep next to them. Our lives are stored in bits, messages turned to network packets. Living spaces arranged in human-sized pixels. But behind the familiar interface, the inner workings still seem so distant. For most of us the window into our digital lives is opaque."<br>Tech for humanist uses VS consumerist uses, how many things does a computer or phone need? How much tech should be implemented in public spaces or businesses? Does your car need a TV in the center console with digital buttons? Especially when a tank of gas is $50? I don't think so<p>
