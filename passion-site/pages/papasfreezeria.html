  <p>The Papa Louie series of games on Coolmath Games were all definitely tried and played by me in elementary and middle school. I mostly played these games when I had computer access at school during breaks, and Papa’s Freezeria quickly became my favorite. Maybe it’s because I do have a sweet tooth in real life, but something about making and completing orders in this game and clocking in and out was so satisfying and entertaining. I think I anticipated the real adult world to be like this where I’d have a fun milkshake-making job on a boardwalk in a colorful cartoon universe full of people who loved food and sweet treats just as much as me. Now that I’m writing this, that does sound like a dream come true if it weren’t for the realities of having a ~job~. I don’t know if there was an ending to this game or not because I would play for a while but never have progress saved if I was swapping around computers, but I’m sure I could find that information out. Apparently there is a deeper storyline within this Papa Louie universe and I’m curious about it because what could possibly be going down in that game universe of fast-food restaurants.
