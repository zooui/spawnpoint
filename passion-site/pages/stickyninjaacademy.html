  <p>This game is probably lesser known because I found it on CoolMath Games and it wasn’t the most popular game on the site. I discovered this game while sitting on either a school desktop or ThinkPad laptop they provided at school during “indoor recess” in elementary school on rainy days or in homebase during middle school. The aim of the game was to jump around as a ninja character through 2D courses that challenged me with enemies, obstacles, and perfecting a score of having the least amount of leaps I can also while my character has sticky feet that attach to each wall I hop to. I got my friends in school to play it too because I told them this game was so fun despite all the other popular games on CoolMath. I even began to get on CoolMath on my parents’ work laptop at home and play all the levels there while trying to get fewer jumps to improve my ninja skills. To say I was addicted to this game at one point is an understatement. It was so simple with style and gameplay but I really found myself lost within it and wanting to get better at it even though it’s a simple and inconclusive level-based game.</p>
